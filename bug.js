In React Native, when using FlatList with a large dataset, you might encounter performance issues if you are not using keyExtractor properly.  If the keyExtractor is missing or not correctly implemented, it can lead to slow rendering, unexpected behavior, and even crashes.  Specifically, React Native relies on the keys to efficiently update and render the list items. If the keys are not unique and stable, it will cause unnecessary re-renders and slow downs.
